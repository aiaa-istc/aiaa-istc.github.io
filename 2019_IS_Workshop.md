### Purpose:

The workshop is an important part of the AIAA Intelligent Systems Technical Committee (ISTC) annual activities and provides an informal, unclassifed, international forum for the exchange of ideas and information on intelligent systems. The workshop broadly focuses on the four following categories:
1. Human Machine Interaction,
2. Vulnerabilities/security of intelligent and autonomous systems,
3. Integrating Autonomy into Existing Ecosystems,
4. Developing an Intelligent Systems Workforce.

Through the various sessions, speeches and discussions, we plan to engage participants on these state-of-the-art topics and their ensuing issues to help provide a better understanding on the vision, capabilities, and challenges for future intelligent and autonomous systems.

### Workshop Agenda

The Workshop is spread over 2 days and 4 sessions. July 29th, 2019 (Monday) will mark the beginning of the workshop. Sessions 1 and 2 will be on this day (Day 1). Sessions 3 and 4 will take place on Day 2. The optional tours are arranged on Day 3, that is, July 31st, 2019. Its scheduled to begin at 7:30 AM each day and go on until 5:00 PM. There will be Social after 5:30 PM on Day 1 and Technical Committee Meeting from 5:30 PM to 7:30 PM on Day 2. The full Workshop Agenda can be downloaded through the link below.

### Student Talk & Poster Session

As part of the 2019 Intelligent Systems workshop in Cincinnati, we will have a student lightning talk session and a student poster session. During these sessions, students will have the opportunity to present their research in 5-minute lightning talks or via posters. Any research topics within the intelligent systems area are welcome. This is a great opportunity for students to promote their research, practice their technical presentation skills, and network with peers in academia, industry, and government. Thanks to the generosity of UC and other sponsors, the workshop is going to be extremely affordable for students this year, with a registration cost of $35 and lodging costs of $43 per night! If you have any questions about the student session, please feel free to contact Dani Selva dselva@tamu.edu and/or the workshop co-chairs Raj Sharma sharmar7@ucmail.uc.edu and Zarrin Chua Chua.Zarrin@aurora.aero.
