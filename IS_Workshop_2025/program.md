<h2 align="center">Intelligent Systems Workshop</h2>
<h3 align="center">POSTPONED UNTIL 2026</h3> <!-- Dates: June 3-4, 2025 -->
<!-- <h3 align="center">Holiday Inn Fairborn, Dayton, OH</h3> -->

Due to the restrictions on government travel and training, we made the call to officially cancel the AIAA Intelligent Systems Workshop on 3-4 June, yesterday (as of March 20, 2025). Itâ€™s sad especially given our all-star lineup of speakers! Hopefully things will settle down soon and we can plan something for next year.

<!-- The 10th annual Intelligent Systems Workshop will take place June 3-4, 2025, at the Holiday Inn Fairborn in Dayton, OH. -->

<h3 align="center" style="color:red;">This year's workshop theme: Misson-Centric Autonomy</h3>
