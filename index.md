**Abstract:** Autonomous systems that are capable of operating self-sufficiently and independent of external control are crucial for the space domain. The biggest advancements in autonomy have been limited to simulated systems, but recent work has demonstrated promise in the real world. However, there are still issues with ensuring the autonomy acts safely and in a trustworthy manner. To this end, we must ensure the safe and robust transfer of high- performing autonomy from the simulated environments they are trained in, to the real-world, physical systems. In this talk, we overview our recent work in training and deploying safe Neural Network Controllers (NNCs) and bringing the solutions from simulation to the real world.

**Bio:** Nathaniel "Nate" Hamilton is the Safe Reinforcement Learning Lead on the Safe Autonomy Team at the Air Force Research Laboratory' Autonomy Capability Team (ACT3). There he investigates Safe Reinforcement Learning (SafeRL) approaches and how we can better integrate safety into the learning process to enable safe, trusted, and certifiable autonomous and learning-enabled controllers for aircraft and spacecraft applications. His previous experience includes studying how Run Time Assurance (RTA) impacts the learning and performance of SafeRL agents, and work in simulation to real-world (sim2real) transfer for learning-enabled controllers. In 2019, Dr. Hamilton was awarded the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship. Dr. Hamilton has a BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Lipscomb University, and an MS and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Vanderbilt University.

Passcode: 013418

**Abstract:** High-level autonomy in previously unseen or abruptly changed conditions faces a critical conceptual challenge: if the controller has no comprehensive system model and no prior opportunity to collect data and train its strategy, how can we form guarantees about system safety or performance? In fact, how do we know whether the system's task is even feasible? Indeed, standard approaches of learning-based control require a wealth of available data, while classical methods of robust and adaptive control respond to highly structured uncertainties. Additionally, attempting to determine a control strategy to complete a predetermined task does not reflect the limits of the system's capabilities: the system might be unable to perform the old task in novel conditions. Instead, an intelligent planner should understand which tasks can certifiably be completed given the current knowledge, and then formulate appropriate control laws. To move towards that goal, in this talk I will present an emergent twin efforts of design-time guaranteed resilience and mission-time guaranteed performance. Combining methods of optimal control, reachability analysis, and differential geometry, these approaches compute a set of tasks completable under all system dynamics consistent with the planner’s partial knowledge, and synthesize appropriate control laws using online learning and adaptation. In describing this framework, this talk will briefly present several applications to aerial and space vehicles, identifying promising future directions of research such as safety-assured reachability, verifiable performance with faulty sensing, and data-driven incremental certification.

**Abstract:** The talk focuses on perception and planning algorithms for autonomous vehicles in off-road situations. A particular emphasis is on why off-road vehicles are different than on-road vehicles and how can we solve autonomy in the off-road domain. A major portion of the talk will be on applications of the above algorithms to real vehicles and the lessons that we have learned i.e. what worked and what didn't and how we should go about building such systems. I will also briefly touch on our work on Autonomous Landing and Obstacle Avoidance for UAVs.

**Abstract:** Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a crucial technology in various civilian and commercial applications. While most UAV applications involve a single UAV, many new applications are expected to demand cooperative computing capabilities among multiple UAVs. This trend presents opportunities for researchers to address fundamental challenges across a range of disciplines, from aerospace to control, communication, networking, and computing. With multiple UAVs sharing computing resources, the networked multi-UAV system can also provide on-demand computing services to ground users, essentially functioning as a flying cloud. However, enabling reliable and efficient networked airborne computing requires overcoming many formidable challenges such as 3-dimensional node mobility, highly uncertain operating environment, and strict safety requirements. In this talk, this new and cross-disciplinary area will be explored, and recent research results we have developed to enable networked airborne computing will be presented.

**Abstract:** Using autonomy within safety-critical applications demands strong assurances the system will not misbehave. Rather than direct analysis and verification, which can be hard, we instead explore using surrogate modeling. With surrogate modeling, we can create models that closely approximate system behaviors while being more amenable to formal verification methods that can prove system safety. We explore this strategy in two contexts: one for closed-loop neural network control system verification and one for approximating nonlinear dynamical systems using Koopman Operator approximations.

**Abstract:** To facilitate and solve the prediction problem, awareness of the current health state of the system is key, since it is necessary to perform condition-based predictions. To accurately predict the future state of any system, it is required to possess knowledge of its current health state and future operational conditions. Latest achievements of data-driven algorithms in regression of complex nonlinear functions and classification tasks have generated a growing interest in artificial intelligence for industrial applications. Complex multi-physics models as well as digital twins, once purely built on physics and corresponding simplified lumped parameter iterations, can now benefit from machine learning algorithms to mitigate the lack of understanding of some complex behavior. Given models of the current and future system behavior, a general approach of model-based prognostics can solve the prediction problem and further decision making. In principle, data driven approaches can replace expensive experimental test-setups as well as reduce the number of simulations needed to explore, e.g., the parametric space of a multi-parameter model. Nonetheless, the limitations of pure data-driven methods came to light rather quickly, at least for some industries. In many industrial applications, data acquisition is costly, and the volume of data that can be collected does not satisfy the requirements for an effective model training and cross-validation. Therefore, some recent works in the area of machine learning is focusing on blending physics with data-driven algorithms, thus mitigating the drawbacks of the two approaches and emphasizing respective advantages. Partial physical knowledge of the problem can aid the learning process by “guiding” the algorithm towards efficient solutions that satisfy the physics driving the system behavior. The result is a hybrid modeling approach combining physical knowledge as well data driven methods to develop a unified hybrid approach. A hybrid framework for fusing information from physics-based performance models along with deep learning algorithms for prognostics of complex safety critical systems is presented. In this framework, physics-based performance models infer unobservable model parameters related to the system's components health solving a calibration problem in the deep learning approach.
