Passcode: MS2b6ME^

**Abstract:** To facilitate and solve the prediction problem, awareness of the current health state of the system is key, since it is necessary to perform condition-based predictions. To accurately predict the future state of any system, it is required to possess knowledge of its current health state and future operational conditions. Latest achievements of data-driven algorithms in regression of complex nonlinear functions and classification tasks have generated a growing interest in artificial intelligence for industrial applications. Complex multi-physics models as well as digital twins, once purely built on physics and corresponding simplified lumped parameter iterations, can now benefit from machine learning algorithms to mitigate the lack of understanding of some complex behavior. Given models of the current and future system behavior, a general approach of model-based prognostics can solve the prediction problem and further decision making. In principle, data driven approaches can replace expensive experimental test-setups as well as reduce the number of simulations needed to explore, e.g., the parametric space of a multi-parameter model. Nonetheless, the limitations of pure data-driven methods came to light rather quickly, at least for some industries. In many industrial applications, data acquisition is costly, and the volume of data that can be collected does not satisfy the requirements for an effective model training and cross-validation. Therefore, some recent works in the area of machine learning is focusing on blending physics with data-driven algorithms, thus mitigating the drawbacks of the two approaches and emphasizing respective advantages. Partial physical knowledge of the problem can aid the learning process by “guiding” the algorithm towards efficient solutions that satisfy the physics driving the system behavior. The result is a hybrid modeling approach combining physical knowledge as well data driven methods to develop a unified hybrid approach. A hybrid framework for fusing information from physics-based performance models along with deep learning algorithms for prognostics of complex safety critical systems is presented. In this framework, physics-based performance models infer unobservable model parameters related to the system's components health solving a calibration problem in the deep learning approach.

**Speaker:** K. Merve Dogan, Ph.D.<br>

**Title:** Verifiable Adaptive Architectures for Control of Safety-Critical Systems

**Meeting recording:** [https://aiaa.zoom.us/rec/share/GTFMHwZAa1IdfGtBoh03bvAawngJTKtBUtSejTbOoVe5_tB9F8Yk4YyP1LUUX9Tt.VhJ0RTNIlJRcYQtj](AIAA Zoom link)<br>
Passcode: 7r..TFrc

**Abstract:** Model reference adaptive control (MRAC) methods are powerful mathematical tools for safety-critical sole and multiagent systems, where they have the capability to suppress the effect of exogenous disturbances and system uncertainties for achieving a desired level of closed-loop system response.  However, the closed-loop system stability with these methods can be challenged for a wide array of applications that involve unmodeled dynamics (e.g., rigid body systems coupled with flexible appendages, airplanes with high aspect ratio wings, and high-speed vehicles with rigid body and flexible dynamics coupling) and actuator dynamics (e.g., cooperation of low and high speed autonomous vehicles).  Motivated by this standpoint, this seminar will introduce verifiable MRAC architectures for both sole and multiagent systems, where we will show the stability tradeoffs of these architectures in the presence of unmodeled and actuator dynamics as well as system uncertainties.  In order to bridge the gap between theory and practice, several simulation and experimental results will be also presented.
