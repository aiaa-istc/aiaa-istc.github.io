## Public Outreach

The AIAA Intelligent Systems Technical Committee (ISTC) is concerned with the application of Intelligent System (IS) technologies and methods to aerospace systems, the verification and validation of these systems, and the education of the AIAA membership in the use of IS technologies in aerospace and other technical disciplines.

### "What is an Intelligent System?" Video Contest

<h1 align="center">ISTC I@A 2012 Video Contest<br>
“What is an Intelligent System?”</h1>

### Contest Overview:

The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) Intelligent Systems Technical Committee (ISTC) is hosting a national video contest that encourages students to think about what it means to be an intelligent system and the impact these systems have on the design and development of Aerospace technologies.

It is not uncommon for there to be disagreement over the definition of an Intelligent System (IS). Now in attempt to motivate young minds and promote IS, the ISTC is asking students create a short (60-90 second) video that attempts to answer this question: “What is an Intelligent System”?

### Past Contests and Winners:

To learn how student projects run by the ISTC can be more effective in the future on a larger scale, the “What is an IS?” video contest was implemented at a local level. The contest asked students to create a short (60-90 second) video that attempts to answer this question: “What is an Intelligent System”? Dr. Cohen at the University of Cincinnati took the contest after the first year’s implementation “as is” and used it as a homework assignment in his *Introduction to Systems Engineering* course for sophomores in Aerospace Engineering. In the fall and spring semesters in the 2012/2013 school year, 34 and 9 videos were collected, respectively. The top videos were narrowed down and given to the ISTC’s Outreach Subcommittee for judging and feedback. Judges found the quality of videos to be fantastic in implementation, content, and creativity! Winners for each semester were given certificates of recognition by the TC (see results below).

### Future Contests:

In the future of this project, the TC will promote this package to other universities and encourage them to implement it in comparable courses. Additionally, this opens the project up to other related video contests that can be held more globally. For example, we’d like to ask students who complete school projects to create a similar short video describing their project and how they have used Intelligent Systems. These types of projects can “easily” reach students on a global scale. By learning from past implementations of this contest, we are working on how to encourage good students to participate and marketing by working with others who have solid connections in the outreach community to facilitate our involvement!

Future contest dates and deadlines are TBD.

### Intelligent Systems 2012 Year In Review
### Call for Highlights

<h1 align="center">Intelligent Systems 2012 Year In Review<br>
Aerospace America magazine<br>
Due date: September 6, 2012</h1>

*********************************************************************

This is a call for submissions for the "Year In Review" December, 2012 issue of Aerospace America magazine. We are looking for summaries of interesting aerospace applications of intelligent systems, approximately 150 words in length, with an accompanying graphic if possible. Each input will be integrated within an overall narrative, so key organizations/affiliations should be identified within the text to enable proper credit to be given. The AIAA Intelligent Systems Technical Committee will select, from among all submissions received, a subset that will be highlighted in the year-end issue of Aerospace America magazine.

*********************************************************************

### SUBMISSION:

Deadline: Thursday, September 6, 2012

Please forward any submissions directly to Kristin.Y.Rozier@nasa.gov.

*********************************************************************

### HIGHLIGHT GUIDELINES:

* 150 words
* describing an advancement in research relating to aerospace intelligent systems
* describing work that occurred or is projected to occur between January and December, 2012
* identifying key organizations/affiliations 
* with an accompanying graphic, if possible: high-resolution TIFs or JPGs, 300 dpi; please send graphics separate from the text
* including a URL, if applicable, for further information
*********************************************************************

### ARTICLE INFORMATION:

This article will cover the most important developments this year in aerospace intelligent systems. Breakthroughs, setbacks, and industry trends that have occurred during the past year, the reasons they are important, and their impact on the aerospace community are also relevant.

More information on what types of aerospace systems qualify as intelligent is available here: https://info.aiaa.org/tac/isg/ISTC/Web%20Pages/What%20Is%20An%20Intelligent%20System.aspx.

 Aerospace America reaches 40,000 people in a broad cross section of disciplines. highlights should be written so that all of them are able to understand the content.
