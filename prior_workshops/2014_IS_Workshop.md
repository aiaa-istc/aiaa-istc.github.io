### Results:

The workshop was a great success! The public files from the event can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B6oiMTIwOs8ic1dpMHAtajNoWmM&usp=sharing).

### Purpose:

The purpose of the 2014 Intelligent Systems Workshop is to chart a course for integrating Intelligent Systems into the aerospace technology. The format of the workshop will not follow traditional conferences and forums, with researchers presenting the state-of-the-art results. Rather, the Intelligent Systems Workshop will bring together experts from government, industry, and academia to discuss the current state of intelligent systems within the aerospace community and to identify problems/applications in the aerospace community that can be addressed through the use of intelligent systems, and clearly articulate how intelligent systems can address these aerospace applications.

The outcome from this workshop will be to help popularize intelligent systems, particularly in the AIAA and to form a basis for government research funding of the gaps identified.
