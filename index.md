**Abstract:** Model reference adaptive control (MRAC) methods are powerful mathematical tools for safety-critical sole and multiagent systems, where they have the capability to suppress the effect of exogenous disturbances and system uncertainties for achieving a desired level of closed-loop system response.  However, the closed-loop system stability with these methods can be challenged for a wide array of applications that involve unmodeled dynamics (e.g., rigid body systems coupled with flexible appendages, airplanes with high aspect ratio wings, and high-speed vehicles with rigid body and flexible dynamics coupling) and actuator dynamics (e.g., cooperation of low and high speed autonomous vehicles).  Motivated by this standpoint, this seminar will introduce verifiable MRAC architectures for both sole and multiagent systems, where we will show the stability tradeoffs of these architectures in the presence of unmodeled and actuator dynamics as well as system uncertainties.  In order to bridge the gap between theory and practice, several simulation and experimental results will be also presented.

Jon How's keynote at SciTech 2022

Don’t miss Prof. Jonathan How’s keynote at SciTech 2022 on January 3rd at 11:30am PST. Professor How will talk about “Deploying Autonomy in an Uncertain World”. More info at [https://www.aiaa.org/SciTech/program](https://www.aiaa.org/SciTech/program) and below!

**Date/time:** Monday, January 3rd, 2022 -- 11:30 PST

**Title:** Deploying Autonomy in an Uncertain World

**Abstract:** As autonomy capabilities have matured, there is growing interest in transitioning algorithms from the laboratory to the field. However, this typically leads to a painful exercise in which prior assumptions end up being violated and algorithms tend to break down, leading to poor performance in the real-world. The types of challenges faced in the real-world include disturbances (e.g., wind gusts) and modeling errors, imperfect communication networks, and the limited capabilities of onboard perception systems. This talk will describe recent advances in accounting for these types of real-world uncertainties in autonomy algorithms. To handle disturbances, I will describe a new learning approach that uses Robust Tube MPC during training to augment an expert’s training set, which is shown to enable a multirotor to learn to fly through turbulence from only a few demonstrations collected without any disturbances acting on the vehicle.  To support distributed autonomy and estimation with limited communication resources, I will discuss developing censoring rules and learned communication policies to enable agents to determine if communicating for a specific navigation or planning task is justified given the message importance and network congestion. To account for the constraints of onboard perception systems (e.g., limited range and field-of-view, and corrupted by noise) I will highlight recent work on targetless multi-sensor calibration and perception-aware motion planning. Finally, the talk will motivate and outline methods for certifying the safety and performance properties of learning-based approaches, which requires ensuring that the uncertainty in the understanding of the real world is appropriately captured in the models used by the autonomous systems. 

**Bio:** Jonathan P. How is the Richard C. Maclaurin Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He received a B.A.Sc. (aerospace) from the University of Toronto in 1987, and his S.M. and Ph.D. in Aeronautics and Astronautics from MIT in 1990 and 1993, respectively, and then studied for 1.5 years at MIT as a postdoctoral associate. Prior to joining MIT in 2000, he was an assistant professor in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Stanford University. 

Dr. How was the editor-in-chief of the IEEE Control Systems Magazine (2015-19) and is an associate editor for the AIAA Journal of Aerospace Information Systems and the IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems. He was an area chair for International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2019) and will be the program vice-chair (tutorials) for the Conference on Decision and Control (2021).

Two of our TC members were featured in a news article recently!

**Analysis: Sanitization Drones Could Improve Campus Safety**  
[EDTECH Magazine](https://edtechmagazine.com/higher/article/2020/08/clean-sweep-how-sanitization-drones-can-improve-campus-safety) (8/10, Stone) reports that “at the University of Michigan, Aerospace Engineering Professor Ella Atkins envisions a school using UAVs to clean learning spaces.” Said Atkins, “If the drone can pop up above the tables and chairs and spray a fast-drying solution, just zipping back and forth in a regular pattern, there’s no way a human could do that nearly as fast. That has real possibilities.” A small drone “likely couldn’t carry enough cleaning fluid to get the job done,” but “running a lightweight hose from the drone back to a bucket of solution introduces challenges.” Said Kelly Cohen, interim head of the Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics at the University of Cincinnati, “There are spaces where you have a lot of students congregating, maybe moving from one building to another, and that open space could be disinfected by drones.”
