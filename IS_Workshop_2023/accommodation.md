## Travel

### Traveling to Boulder:
**From Denver International Airport (recommended):** about 35-40 min drive from Boulder:
[https://www.flydenver.com/](https://www.flydenver.com/) (use to check North/South Security status, among other things; TSA Pre is usually located at one end or the other to speed things up - check before you go!)
* Uber/Lyft/Taxi: ~$75-100 from DIA to Boulder
* RTD AB Bus Line to Downtown Boulder Bus Station: ~$10.50, leaves every hour both ways, tickets and passes can be purchased at station/DIA or online: [https://www.rtd-denver.com/app/route/AB/schedule?direction=westbound](https://www.rtd-denver.com/app/route/AB/schedule?direction=westbound) 
* EightBlack Shuttle (must reserve in advance; can schedule door to door pickup/dropoff from DIA to Boulder and vice versa,): ~$61 one way: [https://eightblackairportshuttle.com/](https://eightblackairportshuttle.com/)
* Rental car options also available at DIA: shuttle buses will take you from Arrivals Level 5 at DIA Terminal to rental car lots (located ~1 mi from DIA Terminal) - look for the signs at Terminal: [https://www.flydenver.com/parking_transit/car-rentals](https://www.flydenver.com/parking_transit/car-rentals)

**Notes for those traveling on own by car:** there are three main highway routes to get to Boulder from DIA: two involve a toll road (Colorado 470; $4.75 per station or ~$16 one way); the other route (via I-270 and US 36) bypasses the toll route and is free, but takes 5-10 mins longer typically and tends to get more heavy traffic - the non-toll route can get delayed during weekday rush hour, so plan accordingly!

**From Colorado Springs:** about 2 hour drive from Boulder: take I-25 North to US-36 West
