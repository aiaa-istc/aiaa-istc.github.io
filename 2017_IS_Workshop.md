### Purpose:

The 2017 Intelligent Systems Workshop will build on on momentum created during the 2014 workshop in Dayton, OH, the 2015 workshop at NASA Ames, and the 2016 workshop at NASA Langley, as well as the panel discussions during the 2015 AIAA SCITECH Forum in Kissimmee, FL and the 2016 AIAA SCITECH Forum in San Diego, CA.

Specifically, this meeting will gather together private sector, government, and academic interests whose research and development work supports interdisciplinary applications of intelligent systems.

Join experts in the field as we convene to present and discuss autonomy and cognitive assistance capabilities in a format aiming to cross-pollinate ideas across different cultures and domains. The presentations and panel sessions will include examples of private sector, government, and academic projects and applications that focus on evolving and emerging Aerospace and Autonomous Systems applications.

An output of the workshop will be topics for updating the ISTC roadmap and ideas for new collaborations, invited sessions, and future workshops and tutorials, as a result of discussions and input from attendees at the workshop.

A modest registration fee ($150 per person) will be assessed to cover continental breakfasts, lunches and drinks/snacks.  The conference registration website contains further details and instructions. Note that the conference registration fee does <b>not</b> include tickets to the (optional) Henry Ford Museum / Greenfield Village trip, which will require a separate admission fee.
