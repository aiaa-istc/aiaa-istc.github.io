### Purpose:

The 2016 Intelligent Systems Workshop will build on momentum created during the 2014 workshop in Dayton, OH, and the 2015 workshop at NASA Ames, as well as the panel discussions during the 2015 AIAA SCITECH Forum in Kissimmee, FL and the 2016 AIAA SCITECH Forum in San Diego, CA. The first full draft of the Roadmap for Intelligent Systems for Aerospace, as result of these workshops and panel discussions, has been released and is available for viewing before the workshop [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uxyjI5Su051A2bzKB6TEyK6vKVZzrM_P).

Specifically, this meeting will gather together private sector, government, and academic interests whose research and development work supports intelligent systems in aerospace.

Join experts in the field as we convene to exchange new ideas and discuss pathways for moving autonomous aerospace systems forward. The presentations and panel sessions will include examples of private sector, government, and academic projects and applications that focus on intelligent air and space systems.

An output of the workshop will be the updated roadmap in the second edition as a result of discussions and input from attendees at the workshop.
