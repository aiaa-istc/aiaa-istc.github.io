### Mission
**The Mission of the Intelligent Systems Technical Committee is fourfold:**
1. **Advance basic principles and fundamental understanding of Intelligent Systems** across the full spectrum of aerospace applications through technical publications, technical conferences, discipline working groups, and educational outreach.
1. **Expand the horizon for aerospace applications of Intelligent Systems** through technical discovery, technology and methodology advancements, technical assessments, outreach and advocacy.
1. **Provide professional development** and networking opportunities to TC members and others involved with conception, design, development, testing, deployment, operations, maintenance, and management of intelligent aerospace systems.
1. **Define, engage and explore interdisciplinary interfaces** through inter-TC, and inter-professional initiatives, and the organization of special technical conference sessions, tutorials, working groups and study groups.

### Scope
The scope of the Intelligent System Technical Committee includes:
* Civil, commercial and military aerospace systems, and those ground systems that are part of development, test, or operations of aerospace systems.
* Technologies that enable safe, cost-efficient, and reliable operation of highly autonomous complex aerospace, land, and sea systems, or collaborative synthetic-human agent teams.

Intelligent Systems technology areas include, but are not limited to:

### Duties
Every member of the ISTC has the following ongoing responsibilities:
* Express an interest in activities of ISTC.
* Be responsive to emails or phone calls from the TC Chair and the chairs of the sub-committees of which they are members.
* Take part in, and actively support the projects of, at least two sub-committees.
* Participate actively in TC-wide initiatives (such as Infotech@Aerospace Conference support and JAIS Special Issue paper reviews).
* Commit to being physically present at a minimum of one TC meeting per year and to try to dial into meetings they cannot attend.
* Promote the TCâ€™s activities to their coworkers and colleagues who might have an interest and be on the lookout for opportunities to promote IS technology and applications.
* Report any concerns regarding their participation in the TC or a sub-committee to the TC and/or sub-committee chair.
