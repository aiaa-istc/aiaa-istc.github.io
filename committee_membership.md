### Scope

The scope of the Intelligent System Technical Committee includes:

* Civil, commercial and military aerospace systems, and those ground systems that are part of development, test, or operations of aerospace systems
* Technologies that enable safe, cost-efficient, and reliable operation of highly autonomous complex aerospace, land, and sea systems, or collaborative synthetic-human agent teams.

Intelligent Systems technology areas include, but are not limited to:
* Data fusion
* Reasoning and Learning Techniques
* Evolutionary (genetic) algorithms
* Expert systems
* Fuzzy logic
* Human-machine interaction
* Intelligent and adaptive control
* Integrated Communication and Navigation
* Autonomous Rendezvous and Docking
* Robotics
* In-Orbit Servicing
* Intelligent data/image processing
* Knowledge-based systems and knowledge engineering
* Machine learning techniques
* Model-based reasoning
* Neural networks
* Planning and scheduling algorithms
* Qualitative simulation

### Duties

Every member of the ISTC has the following ongoing responsibilities:
* Express an interest in activities of ISTC.
* Be responsive to emails or phone calls from the TC Chair and the chairs of the subcommittees of which they are membe
* Take part in, and actively support the projects of, at least two sub-committees
