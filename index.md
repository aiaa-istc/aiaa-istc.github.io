#### Welcome to the ISTC

<small>ISTC Focus: Commercial and military aerospace systems, and those ground systems that are part of test, development, or operations of aerospace systems. Technologies which enable safe and reliable operation of complex aerospace systems or sub-systems with minimal or no human intervention (autonomy), or collaborative synthetic-human agent teams are of interest. These include, but are not limited to: autonomous and expert systems, discrete planning/scheduling algorithms, intelligent data/image processing, learning and adaptive techniques, data fusion and reasoning, and knowledge engineering.</small>

<small>Members of the ISTC have experience in developing and managing aerospace systems involving knowledge engineering, knowledge acquisition, verification/validation of knowledge based systems, neural networks, and expert systems, as well as the use of artificial intelligence concepts/techniques to support natural language interfaces, image understanding, planning/scheduling, and data fusion.</small>

The AIAA Sharepoint site seems to have been having issues for a couple of weeks now. Not sure what's going on, but it's sped up our move to another webhost for public dissemination of ISTC-related information.

If you want to see the old site as of January 2, 2018 (prior to recent updates), you can visit it via the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine at [this location](https://web.archive.org/web/20180102071918/https://info.aiaa.org/tac/isg/ISTC/default.aspx).
