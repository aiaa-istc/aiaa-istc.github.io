<h2 align="center">Intelligent Systems Workshop</h2>
<h3 align="center">POSTPONED UNTIL 2026</h3> <!-- Dates: June 3-4, 2025 -->
<!-- <h3 align="center">Holiday Inn Fairborn, Dayton, OH</h3> -->

Due to the restrictions on government travel and training, we made the call to officially cancel the AIAA Intelligent Systems Workshop on 3-4 June, yesterday (as of March 20, 2025). It’s sad especially given our all-star lineup of speakers! Hopefully things will settle down soon and we can plan something for next year.

<!--The 10th annual Intelligent Systems Workshop will take place June 3-4, 2025, at the Holiday Inn Fairborn in Dayton, OH.

**This year's workshop theme: Misson-Centric Autonomy**

Join us for two days of technical sessions covering a wide range of topics. Engage with top experts in the field through interactive topic panels, participate in exciting breakout sessions, hear from some of the nation’s brightest students in the student poster and lightning talk competitions, and tour local areas in the region.

Keynote speakers are coming soon! --> <!-- Confirmed keynote speakers include Dr. Jim Paunicka (Technical Fellow, Autonomy Capabilities Team, Boeing CTO Office) and Dr. Steve Chien (JPL Fellow, Supervisor of the Artificial Intelligence Group). -->
