<h2 align="center">Intelligent Systems Workshop</h2>
<h3 align="center">POSTPONED UNTIL 2026</h3> <!-- Dates: June 3-4, 2025 -->
<!-- <h3 align="center">Holiday Inn Fairborn, Dayton, OH</h3> -->

## Venue

Due to the restrictions on government travel and training, we made the call to officially cancel the AIAA Intelligent Systems Workshop on 3-4 June, yesterday (as of March 20, 2025). It’s sad especially given our all-star lineup of speakers! Hopefully things will settle down soon and we can plan something for next year.

<!-- The workshop will be held at Holiday Inn Fairborn, in Dayton, OH.

More details are coming soon! -->
<!-- Most of the workshop will take place in the ??? Building, [??](??) ??, ??, NE ?????</a>.-->

<!--The ?? building is a short ?? min car ride or ?? min walk from hotels along ?? Boulevard, and about ??-?? mins walk from the ?? Hotel on the ?? Trail. The ?? Bus also connects ?? Campus to ?? Campus (be sure to get on the “?? Bus”, NOT the “??” bus!). -->
