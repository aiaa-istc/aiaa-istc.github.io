## Open mic session

More info is coming soon!
<!-- We will continue the tradition of the open-mic session at the IS workshop! About 5-10 speakers will have the chance to present for ~5-7 minutes over lunch on July 27. This is a great opportunity to present your work or just give your opinion on a relevant topic. <i>If you would like to present, please email your name and topic <b>by July 15</b> to Dani Selva (dselva@tamu.edu).</i>
