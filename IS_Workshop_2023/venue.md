## Venue
The workshop will be held at University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO. Most of the workshop will take place in the Aerospace Engineering Sciences Building, <a href="[https://goo.gl/maps/BR5BoanTy28Ym5v67](https://goo.gl/maps/BR5BoanTy28Ym5v67)">3775 Discovery Drive, Boulder CO, 80309</a>.

The Aerospace building is a short 5 min car ride or 24 min walk from hotels along Canyon Boulevard, and about 10-15 mins walk from the Millenium Hotel on the Boulder Creek Trail. The CU-operated Buff Bus also connects CU Main Campus to East Campus (be sure to get on the “East Campus Bus”, NOT the “Williams Village” bus!).

### Traveling to Boulder:
**From Denver International Airport (recommended):** about 35-40 min drive from Boulder:
https://www.flydenver.com/ (use to check North/South Security status, among other things; TSA Pre is usually located at one end or the other to speed things up - check before you go!)
* Uber/Lyft/Taxi: ~$75-100 from DIA to Boulder
* RTD AB Bus Line to Downtown Boulder Bus Station: ~$10.50, leaves every hour both ways, tickets and passes can be purchased at station/DIA or online: https://www.rtd-denver.com/app/route/AB/schedule?direction=westbound 
* EightBlack Shuttle (must reserve in advance; can schedule door to door pickup/dropoff from DIA to Boulder and vice versa,): ~$61 one way: https://eightblackairportshuttle.com/ 
* Rental car options also available at DIA: shuttle buses will take you from Arrivals Level 5 at DIA Terminal to rental car lots (located ~1 mi from DIA Terminal) - look for the signs at Terminal:

**Notes for those traveling on own by car:** there are three main highway routes to get to Boulder from DIA: two involve a toll road (Colorado 470; $4.75 per station or ~$16 one way); the other route (via I-270 and US 36) bypasses the toll route and is free, but takes 5-10 mins longer typically and tends to get more heavy traffic - the non-toll route can get delayed during weekday rush hour, so plan accordingly!

**From Colorado Springs:** about 2 hour drive from Boulder: take I-25 North to US-36 West
