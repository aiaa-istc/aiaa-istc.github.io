### Purpose:

The 2015 Intelligent Systems Workshop will build on momentum created during the 2014 workshop in Dayton, OH and the feedback from a multi-hour panel discussion during the 2015 AIAA SCITECH Forum in Kissimmee, FL. Specifically, this workshop is an opportunity to bring together government, industry, and academic experts from a targeted variety of domains.

In particular, this workshop seeks to attract intelligent system experts from outside the aerospace domain, such as those with practical experience building self-driving cars, in order to stimulate interaction and crossfeed lessons learned. In addition, this workshop seeks constructive feedback from outside communities, such as IEEE, on its draft roadmap for intelligent systems.

The outcome from this workshop will help the Roadmap for Intelligent Systems committee revise the draft Roadmap for Intelligent Systems.
